# weather
## Challenge
 - Implement the class WeatherClient, with a method fetchWeatherData that fetches the current weather for a given city using fetch. It should also return a promise, so that we can use the data once it has been received and parsed into an object.
 - Test-drive the class Weather, which uses the class WeatherClient to get the weather for a given city. Make sure the dependency on WeatherClient is mocked.
